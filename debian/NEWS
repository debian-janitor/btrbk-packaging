btrbk (0.32.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

    The default for timestamp_format has changed from "short" to
    "long". If you have not explicitely configured timestamp_format,
    set "timestamp_format short" in btrbk.conf to revert old behavior.

    Restrictions on subvolume names have been dropped (allowing
    whitespace and special characters), changing the way command
    arguments are escaped when called via ssh. If you are using
    "ssh_filter_btrbk.sh" on remote hosts, make sure to update it with
    the latest version.

btrbk (0.27.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

    Due to a bugfix in the scheduler [1] [2], previously preserved
    monthly/yearly backups could get deleted when upgrading to
    btrbk-0.27.0.

    Before upgrading to btrbk-0.27.0, make sure to stop all cron jobs
    or systemd timers calling btrbk.

    After upgrading, run "btrbk prune --dry-run --print-schedule" and
    check if any snapshots/backups would get deleted. If you want to
    forcibly preserve a snapshot/backup forever, rename it:

        mv mysubvol.YYYYMMDD mysubvol.YYYYMMDD.keep_forever

    Note that btrbk ignores subvolumes with unknown naming scheme, e.g.
    (".keep_forever" suffix in the example above).

btrbk (0.23.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

    As the retention policy semantics changed with btrbk-0.23.0, the
    configuration files created for earlier versions are not
    compatible, and will force btrbk into "failsafe mode". Please read
    "doc/upgrade_to_v0.23.0.md"
    <http://digint.ch/btrbk/doc/archive/btrbk-0.23.0/upgrade_to_v0.23.0.html>
    before upgrading to btrbk-0.23.0.
    We apologize for the inconvenience.
